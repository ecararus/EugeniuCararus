# Summary
I'm specialising in building distributed applications, I mainly used traditional Java and J2EE technology stack
 on tomcat/jetty/weblogic server by using SpringFramework, Struts MVC with Hibernate and Mule ESB, and
 many other technology and tools.
 
I have 10 years of professional experience worked in various very interesting and demanding projects,
 mainly large scale distributed projects. I had a chance to work in big multi-threaded, concurrent, standalone
 application, but also I had chance to work on greenfield projects mainly at Mobiteam at the beginning of my
 career path.
 
Following trends I recently started to focus more on functional languages, I'm learning Scala and Closure,
 Spark I'm interested in Machine Learning. I studding different NoSQL databases mainly MongoDB and HA/
EC Lucen, as well I'm interested into cloud computing AWS, GC, Cloud Foundry, Heroku. Infrastructure
 configuration/provision management/containerisation Docker, Puppet, Ansible and others HashiCorp products,
 I also worked on projects with different languages/frameworks like Groovy(Grails), PHP(Drupal) or GWT.

I had a chance to work within great agile teams distributed across the world with high coding standards in
 agile environment that valued lean and mature approach, embracing continuous integration and continuous
 delivery, integration tests, unit tests, pair programming by doing continuous codebase refactoring, I'm targeting
 continuous code improvement, and new technologies implementation. In terms of team organisation my slogan
 is "let's build mature and self managed team".
 
Generally I'm very focused, process oriented technical person.
I like knowing how things work around me and I always look for new exciting opportunities.
Personally I like socialise and build good relationship with people around me.
